It is observable that the tendencies may increase, decrease or are stable in different sections of time.  But the overall trend must be upward, downward or stable.<br> <b>Linear and Non-Linear Trend</b> <br> If we plot the time series values on a graph in accordance with time t. The pattern of the data clustering shows the type of trend. If the set of data cluster more or less round a straight line, then the trend is linear otherwise it is non-linear (Curvilinear).",

This oscillatory movement has a period of oscillation of more than a year. One complete period is a cycle. This cyclic movement is sometimes called the ‘Business Cycle’. It is a four-phase cycle comprising of the phases of prosperity, recession, depression, and recovery. The cyclic variation may be regular are not periodic. The upswings and the downswings in business depend upon the joint nature of the economic forces and the interaction between them."

These variations come into play either because of the natural forces or man-made conventions. The various seasons or climatic conditions play an important role in seasonal variations."
